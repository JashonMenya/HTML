# Tag
An opening tag indicates the starting point in the document where the tag takes effect.
```cmd
    <>
```
A closing tag indicates the ending point in the document where the tag stops having an effect.
```cmd
    </>
```

A void element is an element that only needs an opening tag
Examples include :
- ```cmd <img>```
- ```cmd <br>```
- ```cmd <input>```
- ```cmd <meta>```
- ```cmd <link>```
- ```cmd <hr>```
